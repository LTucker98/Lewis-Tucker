# Level Design Jobs

Most careers within the Level Design environment consist of having the same requirements.

Understandably, they would want those applying to have had experience using some of the modern day level building softwares available to the public; e.g. UE4, Unity, CryEngine etc.
They would want you to be able to relay the story and support the narrative throughout the environment.
Also needed is the ability to analyse the game world, and understand what it takes to make the levels enjoyable and replayable.
Being able to create and iterate levels based on feedback is one of the key requirements of most applications as it is needed to improve the consumer experience.
Another key element is that you must be able to work alongside others as they will be working on other features and mechanics that you need to take into account.

Both the applications features the main qualities that is expected at a minimum for the applicant, e.g. Experience with Unity/Unreal, Experience with AI, as well as a degree in Computer Science or equivalent.
